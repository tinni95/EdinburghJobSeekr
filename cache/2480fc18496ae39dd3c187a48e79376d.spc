Overview: In this role the successful candidate will be responsible for the research and development of pixels for photonics devices. This role will bridge the gap between process development (diode design) and circuit design (pixel readout circuitry). The candidate should therefore have a knowledge of CMOS processing and fabrication in addition to circuit design. The aim of this role is to study the pixel operation in detail and understand the key factors which impact performance. This will include the operation of the diode plus the associated readout circuitry. Pixel design specification and performance will be evaluated against product and system requirements and it is the goal of the team to deliver pixels for inclusion in mass market products. In addition to this the pixel team develops and maintains test chips which are used for advanced pixel and diode R&D and this role will require the successful candidate to work on the design of such test chips as well as contributing to the development of advanced pixel and diode designs. This will therefore require close interaction with the design team and also the technology development team at our foundry. This role has unique challenges, such as merging design and simulation aspects with characterization to understand the effects of pixel design and technology on critical figures of merit. This challenging role will provide an opportunity to apply knowledge of process development and solid-state physics to device development taking into consideration product requirements and system constraints within the Photonics roadmap of the Imaging Division. The Role You will be tasked with layout and simulation activities to help the SPAD Pixel Team to design new pixels, and you will be analysing electro-optical characterization data to feed back into the design and simulation. Initially this involves familiarization with existing techniques, methods and databases. You will work in collaboration with local and other European sites, to develop and adopt standard methods and reporting formats. The Key Skills & Experience The candidate must be team focussed and highly motivated. This role requires an understanding of the full photonics system and therefore strong collaboration with colleagues locally and in the wider design/engineering community across the Imaging Division is a key factor for success. Strong communication skills are mandatory.
